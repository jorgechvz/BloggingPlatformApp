# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal with this project was to create an interactive blog application to improve my Kotlin skills and learn more about developing applications using Kotlin.

The app allows users to register, log in, create, edit and delete blogs. I also implemented features like blog search and the ability to publish or unpublish blogs.

My purpose in writing this software was to learn more about Kotlin, especially in terms of its syntax, its object-oriented programming features, and its interaction with JSON files and data.

# DevelopmentEnvironment

For the development of this application, I used the IntelliJ IDEA integrated development environment (IDE). IntelliJ IDEA is a popular IDE for Kotlin and offers a variety of useful features such as code autocompletion, real-time code analysis, and an intuitive user interface. In addition to IntelliJ IDEA, I also used Git for version control.

The main programming language I used for this project was Kotlin. I chose Kotlin for its concise syntax, its interoperability with Java, and its support for functional and object-oriented programming features.

To handle the JSON data in the application, I used the Gson library. Gson is a Google library that can be used to convert Java objects to their JSON representation and vice versa. Used Gson to serialize and deserialize blog and user data by saving and loading it from storage.

Additionally, I used Gradle for project configuration and dependency management. Gradle is a build automation tool that allows you to define project dependencies and build tasks using a Groovy or Kotlin-based DSL. Using Gradle, I was able to manage project dependencies efficiently and configure the build process according to my needs.

# FutureWork

There are several things I plan to improve and add in the future:

- Implement a friendlier user interface.
- Add the ability for users to follow other users and receive notifications when these users publish new posts.
- Improve error handling and validation of user input.
- Implement more security in authentication such as hashing the password
